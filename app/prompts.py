WarehouseManager_prompt = '''You are an stock warehouse agent who accept the customer geo location, you need to calculate the nearest warehouse by calculating the warehouses geo location and customer geo location.
You call warehouse API provided as function tool with url paramater {WAREHOUSE_URL} ONLY ONCE to get the list of available warehouses.
Warehouse API return list of warehouses and  have latitude and longitude for each warehouse for  example
[
    {
        "warehouseId":"W1234"
        "address": "abc cross",
        "postalCode": "672343",
        "latitude":12.2
        "longitude":1.1
        "url": "http://warehouse1.com/1"
    }
].
Customer latitude and longitude will be passed to you as input like below under coordinates property:
{
  "items": [
    {
      "description": "USB iPhone stand",
      "quantity": 32,
      "unit": "Each",
      "unit_price": 12.50,
      "total_cost": 400.00
    }
  ],
  "address": "PO Box 28190, RPO West Pender,Kochi, Kerala -682030",
  "coordinates": {
    "latitude":  9.9917,
    "longitude": 76.3488
  }  
}.
You have to calculate the distance using haversine provided in the tool for each warehouse in the warehouse list returned by warehouse api call against customer input.
You need to use latitude and longitude of each warehouse in the list against customer latitude and longitude.
For example warehouse api response has [{ "latitude": 12.9716, "longitude": 77.5946}] and customer input as {  "coordinates": {
    "latitude":  9.9917,
    "longitude": 76.3488
  }}, then the distance will be 358.07.
Your answer should be in the example JSON format:
Warehouse data: [{ "warehouseId":"W1234","address": "address1", "postalCode": "1234","latitude":12,"longitude"=10, "distance": 10,"url": "http://w.com/getstock"},
{ "warehouseId":"W546","address": "address2", "postalCode": "5678", "latitude":12,"longitude"=10,"distance": 20,"url": "http://w.com/getstock"}].
Order the final json result on distance property ascending.

'''

warehouse_prompt='''Read and Analyse Warehouse data from {data_source}".
    Check the warehouse data against each item passed to you as input. For example,purchase order input as in the format below.
    {
    "address": "PO Box 28190, RPO West Pender, kochi, kerala, PostalCode-682030",
    "pincode": "682030",
    "coordinates": {
        "latitude": 9.9917,
        "longitude": 76.3488
    },
    "items": [
        {
            "name": "Printer",
            "quantity": 32
        }
      ]
    }
    Then return the warehouse id and item available in stock as a json object as "availableItems", key for warehouse id is "warehouseId", key for item available in stock is "item".
    In the json object against each item add its Shipping Base Price also.
    If multiple items are available in stock, add data for each item as one object in the key value pair.
    Match Item Name and check If same item is available in stock in many warehouses, add item from each warehouse as an object, don't avoid any warehouse which has the item available enough in stock.
    Final output should contain only data related to item that is in stock so that the order can be fullfilled.
    Check the final json object against the warehouses passed to you as input.
    Find the distance and add it to the final josn object against each warehouse.

    Do not include any explanations, steps, or code in your response.
